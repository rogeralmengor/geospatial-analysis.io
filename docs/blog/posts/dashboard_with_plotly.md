# Why I Built a Dividend Stock Screener (And How You Can Too)

Let me be straight with you - I've been losing sleep over retirement. Looking at my finances and realizing retirement isn't as far away as I thought has been a real wake-up call. With pension systems barely hanging on, I knew I had to take control of my financial future.

I know everyone says "just buy ETFs" - and honestly, they're probably right. Going with the market is safer than trying to pick winners. But I can't help myself when it comes to diving into individual companies. There's something addictive about analyzing financial statements, dividend histories, and ratios like P/E and payout ratios. Being a numbers person, this stuff genuinely fascinates me.

So I built a [Python tool](#main-script) (and [support function](#support-function)) to help me screen dividend-paying stocks systematically. Here's how it works and why it might help you too. (Go to Code)

## Libraries
Of course you need some things to **"pipinstall"**:

* plotly
* dash
* yfinance
* pandas
* bsd (A simple helper module with function to calculate the BSD formula from the book: [The little book of big dividends](https://www.thalia.de/shop/home/artikeldetails/A1008989339){:target="_blank"})

## The Simple Setup

The whole thing starts with just two parameters:

```python
ticker_symbol = "JNJ"  # Which company to analyze
years_back = 5         # How far back to look
```

That's it. The tool grabs data from Yahoo Finance and does all the heavy lifting from there.

## My 7-Point Screening System

I created seven criteria based on what I've learned from a [dividend investing book](https://www.thalia.de/shop/home/artikeldetails/A1038443853){:target="_blank"} I reference at the end of this post:

**1. Decent yield** - At least 1% annually over 5 years
**2. No suspensions** - Company never stopped paying dividends
**3. No cuts** - Dividends never went backwards
**4. Growth pattern** - At least 2 increases in 5 years
**5. Recent momentum** - Dividend went up last year
**6-7. Smart payout ratio** - Between 33-75% (sustainable but not stingy)

The tool also calculates something called a BSD score, which gives additional insight into business strength.

## What the Dashboard Shows

Using Plotly and Dash, I created visualizations that make the data easy to understand:
- Bar charts showing dividend growth over time
- Pie charts breaking down payout vs. retained earnings
- Clear tables showing which criteria pass or fail

No fancy financial jargon - just clear answers to "Is this a good dividend stock?"

## Testing with Johnson & Johnson

I ran Johnson & Johnson through the screener first. As a Dividend Aristocrat, I expected it to pass - and it did, beautifully. All seven criteria passed, giving me confidence the system actually works.

You can see how this humble dashboard looks like below:

## Why This Helps Me Sleep Better

This isn't about beating the market or finding hidden gems. It's about understanding what I'm investing in. When you're worried about retirement, having systematic ways to evaluate investments provides real peace of mind.

The tool is simple to use - just change the ticker symbol and run it. Within seconds, you know whether a stock meets basic dividend quality standards and can see exactly why.

Of course there are more financial indicators to further evaluate a stock, but that is a first fair attempt. I might expand this dashboard adding more graphs and statistics in the future.

## The Bottom Line

Building this screener has been both educational and therapeutic. It combines my love of numbers with practical retirement planning needs. While ETFs might be the smart money move, having tools to understand individual stocks makes me feel more in control of my financial future.

If you're dealing with similar retirement anxiety, maybe building your own analysis tools could help too. Sometimes the process of understanding is just as valuable as the results.
